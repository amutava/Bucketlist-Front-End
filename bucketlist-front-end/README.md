# Bucketlist FrontEnd
This is a web application created using angular2. It is an application that consumes flaskApi to do simple fuctionalities like creating a bucketlist, editing, deleting and adding items to it. <br/>
This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

## Learning Materials
As a beginner in angualar2 the materials used to achieve the fully functional frontend were:<br/>
* Pluralsight angular2 course by Deborah Kurata.
* Angular website.
* Googling basic errors online and checking out user responses.
* Implementing angular2 applications using angular CLI.
* Cloning the angular2 CLI as the backbone of the application.
* Learning the basics of Javascript is also essential.

## Basic fuctionalities
